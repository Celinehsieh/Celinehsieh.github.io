Zillow is the leading real estate and rental marketplace launched in 2006 which dedicated to empowering consumers with data, 
inspiration and knowledge around the place they call home, and connecting them with the best local professionals who can help.

Zillow serves the full lifecycle of owning and living in a home: buying, selling, renting, financing, remodeling and more. 
It starts with Zillow's living database of more than 110 million U.S. homes - including homes for sale, homes for rent and 
homes not currently on the market, as well as Zestimate home values, Rent Zestimates and other home-related information.  


In order to make a good decision, we have to consider the factors from demographic too. The housing price is affected by average 
household income, real estate tax, age and population changes etc. US Census is a good resource to get the data. 

Since we look into the data by county from 1930-2017. And we approach several aspects to see people would like to rent or buy a house 
if they want to live in new England.
